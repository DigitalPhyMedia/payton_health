                                    hospital partnership) is typically provided without direct charges to patients when
                                    facilitated through partner hospitals. Hospitals may have separate service
                                    agreements with Payton.</p>
                                <p>Additional services, requested directly by a patient (e.g., extensive follow-up on
                                    complex reimbursement claims, appeals for rejected claims, detailed settlement
                                    verification beyond standard checks, handling claims not initiated via a partner
                                    hospital), may incur a service fee.</p>

                                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Service Fees for Additional Services</h3>

                                    upfront about any applicable service fees. We will provide a clear explanation of
                                    the service and the associated charge before you agree to proceed. Pricing is
                                    determined based on the complexity and scope of the requested service and is not
                                    listed on the website.</p>

                                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Payment Method</h3>
